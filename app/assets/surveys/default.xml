     you through the different tags and how to use them to

     in the survey and see how they are affected in the

### This is a survey instruction block

Instruction blocks can be used to give users more information
about the survey, direct them how to answer subsequent
questions, or anything else you want to include.

Make sure there are no spaces at the beginning of the line,
otherwise the system will think that you are trying to display
source code.

This instruction block uses Markdown formatting. Markdown
makes it easy to make things *italic*, **bold**, or to
[add links](http://google.com) to your text.

See the Markdown reference below for more formatting tips.
    </instruction>

    <!-- This is a short text field and provides a single
         line of text entry. Remember to give each question
         a unique ID. -->
    <question id="q1" format="shorttext">
      Decima nihil molestie legunt quam sollemnes. 
    </question>

    <!-- This is a multi-line text field for longer
         responses. -->
    <question id="q2" format="longtext">
      Option sit claritatem usus suscipit usus. 
    </question>

    <!-- This provides the user with a set of radio buttons
         that reflect one of your predefined scales. The
         user can only select one option in a scale. -->
    <question id="q3" format="scale" scale="agree-disagree">
      Velit id eum et videntur quod?
    </question>

    <!-- A pull-down menu allowing the user to choose one
         of several options. This option is very similar to
         a scale, but allows you to include more options
         without making the page too long. -->
    <question id="pulldown-example" format="pulldown">
      Eodem nobis formas euismod nihil saepius. 

      <!-- The value is what gets printed to your results
           data while the text between the tags is what is
           displayed to your users. -->
      <option value="1">Option 1</option>
      <option value="2">Option 2</option>
      <option value="anything">Option 3</option>
    </question>

    <!-- Checkboxes that allow the user to select one or
         more answers. In the results data, the following
         example would have three columns: alpha/a, alpha/b,
         and alpha/c with a 1 or 0 in the column depending
         on whether the user checked the option. -->
    <question id="alpha" format="checkbox">
      Eum eros volutpat ut in nulla.

         will be displayed in a table and that will use
         the same scale for their values. -->

         a dependency on a question from a previous page. To
         set a dependency, use the "depends" attribute and
         reference the ID of the earlier question, then set
         the "dependsvalue" to the value the earlier
         question must have in order for this question to
         be displayed.
         
         Hidden questions will still appear in the results
         data, but will have blank values. -->

      This question only appears if the pulldown on the previous page
      had a value of 2 (Option 2).

         may want to include an instruction block so there
